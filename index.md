PROJ.4 is a C library for performing transformations between cartographic projections. The library is based on the work of Gerald Evenden at the USGS.  The library also ships with executables for performing these transformations from the command line.  PROJ.4 is open source and released under an MIT [license](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/COPYING).
